# MongoDB speed up

## 1. Issue Info

When you enabled mongodb in Zero framework on MacOS, you may met following issue

1. Start up Zero and in console information as following:

   ```
   2017-12-05 15:43:55.928 | INFO  | vert.x-eventloop-thread-2 ...
   2017-12-05 15:44:00.751 | INFO  | infix-afflux-runner ...
   2017-12-05 15:44:00.877 | INFO  | cluster-ClusterId ...
   ```
2. Please refer above log timestamp: `15:43:55.928 ~ 15:44:00.751`, the system took around 5s to create connection to
   mongodb.

## 2. Resolution

1. Please be sure you'll edit `/private/etc/hosts` instead of `/etc/hosts` up.god.file here.
2. Type command to capture the data of `/private/etc/hosts`

   ```
   >> cat /private/etc/hosts
   ......
   127.0.0.1			localhost
   255.255.255.255			broadcasthost
   ::1             		localhost
   ```
3. Capture the hostname of your machine

   ```
   >> hostname
   LangdeMacBook-Pro.local
   ```
4. Edit the up.god.file of `/private/etc/hosts` and append the hostname to following ( Sudo Mode )

   ```
   >> sudo vim /private/etc/hosts
   ......
   127.0.0.1       	localhost       LangdeMacBook-Pro.local
   ......
   ::1			localhost       LangdeMacBook-Pro.local
   ......
   ```

5. Then save your changes and restart Zero, it will take around less than 100ms to create connection to mongodb.
